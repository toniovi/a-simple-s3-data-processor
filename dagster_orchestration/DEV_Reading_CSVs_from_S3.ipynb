    "So, while process_s3_files_job() might seem unnecessary because it's just calling create_asset_from_s3_file(), it's actually doing a lot of important work behind the scenes by integrating with Dagster's job management, configuration, and resource management features.\n",

If this bucket name changes or if you want to use different buckets for different environments (like testing, staging, production), consider making this a configurable parameter or an environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: There doesn't seem to be much error handling in the code. For example, what happens if `s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key)` fails because the file doesn't exist or because of a network error? Adding some error handling could make your code more robust.\n",
